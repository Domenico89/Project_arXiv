# Project_arXiv
Project to help students and young researchers determine which category suits their articles and provides a set of articles that might be relevant to their work.

The notebook Data_Harvesting.ipynb illustrate how to use the arXiv API to get articles metadata and download them in txt form, in Training_Model.ipynb we describe how the model was trained using tfidf and logistic regression. In Recommender_Systems.ipynb we describe how we built the recommender system for the articles and a possible approach on how to evaluate it.
